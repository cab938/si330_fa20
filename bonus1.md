# Bonus Assignment: Creative Instruction (5%)
This bonus assignment is worth up to an additional 5% on your final grade. You make choose __either__ of the two options below for credit, but not both. The assignment is due by __December 10th, 11:59 pm, Ann Arbor time__. The assignment options are intended to both help you reflect on what you know about a given topic as well as creatively "anchor" that topic in your mind (and mine!).

For either option you must upload a single zip file to https://forms.gle/qh4CqxjD91inXhaw6

You can do this in groups of 2 or 3, __but I expect more__ as the group size goes up.

Costumes are optional!

## Option 1: TikTok Regex
Create five ~1 minute tiktok videos teaching me regex concepts. The grading for this assignment is out of a total of 5 possible points, where two points are reserved for accuracy, two points are reserved for my evaluation of the entertainment value, and one point is reserved for putting the videos actually up on tiktok and sharing them with #regex. Duets are fair game, as are dance challenges or whatever else - be creative! But teach me something about regex.

For this submission you can put 5 videos in your zip file, or concatenate them all together into one five minute video.

## Option 2: Rap Battle
Create a 3-5 minute rap battle between two rappers, one representing pandas and the other databases. Gloves off, spit acid! -- you can use whatever language/themes/etc you want, only the instructor will see this and he has thick skin. The grading for this assignment is out of a total of 5 possible points, split evenly between a demonstration of the similarities and differences of the approaches and my evaluation of the entertainment value. Keep in mind that we sit just 30 minutes from Detroit, home to perhaps the world's greatest hip hop artists, Eminem.

For this submission you should put a single video and a transcript of your lyrics in your zip file.
